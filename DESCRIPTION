Description: Using the idea of "tipping point" (proposed in
   Gregory Campbell, Gene Pennello and Lilly Yue(2011)
   <DOI:10.1080/10543406.2011.550094>) to visualize  the results
   of sensitivity analysis for missing data, the package provides
   a set of functions to list out all the possible combinations
   of missing values in two treatment arms, calculate
   corresponding estimated treatment effects and p values, and draw
   a colored heat-map. It could deal with randomized
   experiments with a binary outcome or a continuous outcome. In addition,
   the package provides a visualized method to compare various imputation
   methods by adding the rectangles or convex hulls on the basic plot.
